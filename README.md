# The Dragon Curve

Little project to dynamicallyÂ show the evolution of the recursive construction of the Dragon Curve Fractal and its variants with a light Javascript implementation with the 2D Canvas API.

## WebGL version

The repository now includes `dragon_webgl.html`, a simple WebGL implementation that draws the Dragon Curve using GPU lines. Open the file in a browser with WebGL support to see the fractal iteratively generated.
